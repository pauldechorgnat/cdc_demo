The spokesperson affirmed that the restrictions on calls for assassination apply globally. Meta's earlier decision allows Ukrainian users to post otherwise prohibited calls for violent self-defense or condemnation of Russia's invasion, and effectively created more leeway for users in the country to express support for violence on Meta's platforms. (On Sunday, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation thanked Meta and said the decision \"respect[ed] our right to counter the aggression\" from Russia.)But Meta was forced to clarify its stance after Russia accused it of facilitating \"illegal calls for murder and violence\" against Russian citizens and opened a criminal case against the company. Russia has separately moved to block Facebook and Instagram in the country as part of a crackdown on information about the war in Ukraine, though a growing number of Russian internet users appear determined to circumvent the ban.  Read MoreThe Ukraine-specific policy on hate speech, which is temporary, is \"focused on protecting people's rights to speech as an expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country,\" Clegg said in a public statement Friday. The statement added that Meta has \"no quarrel with the Russian people\" and that \"there is no change at all in our policies on hate speech as far as the Russian people are concerned.\"Clegg's internal post on Sunday doubled down on that position.\"We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general,\" Clegg wrote, adding that the hate-speech carveout for Ukraine applies only to speech \"regarding the Russian military invasion.\"", "keywords": ["tech", "meta", "says", "n't", "allow", "calls", "assassinating", "heads", "state", "cnn"], "category": "business"}, {"author": "Matt Egan, CNN Business", "date_published": "2022-03-14 12:55:43", "section": "investing", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/investing/citi-russia/index.html", "headline": "Citi expands its exit from Russia - CNN", "article_text": "New York (CNN Business)Citigroup, the major US bank with the biggest footprint in Russia, said Monday it will expand its exit from Russia to go beyond the long-planned sale of its consumer bank there.Citi said in a statement it has decided to \"expand the scope\" of its exit process to include \"other lines of business and continue to reduce our remaining operations and exposure\" in Russia.\"Due to the nature of banking and financial services operations, this decision will take time to execute,\" Citi said, adding that it is \"moving with urgency\" to complete the assessment of its Russia operations.Here are the companies pulling back from RussiaCiti did not detail specifically which operations will be unwound, but the bank provides investment and corporate banking services in Russia to institutions and high net-worth individuals.

In the past week, however, the severing of Russia from the global internet went one layer deeper. Two of the world's largest internet service providers, Lumen Technologies and Cogent Communications, said they would block Russian customers from their networks over fears that their networks could be used by the Russian government for cyberattacks against the West. But a knock-on effect is that it will be even harder for citizens in the country to use the worldwide web. The move highlights the tension over Russia's effort to erect what's being called a digital Iron Curtain to close its citizens off from outside information, much like China has done for years. Companies find themselves caught between helping Russians freely access the internet and ensuring their services are not used by the Russian government to spread disinformation, propaganda or worse. The implications are massive. Lumen and Cogent collectively preside over nearly 600,000 miles of optical fiber that forms the piping for the global internet, with each boasting operations in more than 50 countries, according to their websites.Fear of cyberattacksRead MoreBoth companies insist their moves were squarely directed at the Russian government and not the Russian people, and any impediment to the latter's ability to access outside information is an unfortunate side effect. \"We as a company are a very strong believer in an open and uncensored internet,\" Dave Schaeffer, Cogent's CEO, said in an interview with CNN Business. \"This was a very difficult decision.\" Cogent Communications CEO Dave SchaefferAccording to Schaeffer, cutting Russia off is a preventative measure against cyberattacks that may be perpetrated through Cogent's network by the Russian government or individuals linked to it. The company, which is based in Washington D.C., has limited its action to around 25 customers that are incorporated in Russia and are directly on Russian networks, he said. That means Russian businesses that use Cogent's network outside the country through non-Russian state entities can continue to do so.\"We felt that the downside of having the possibility that these connections could be used offensively outweighed the negative of terminating some services,\" he added.An unprecedented decisionLumen, headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, cited similar reasoning for its decision, which came a few days after Cogent's. \"We decided to disconnect the network due to increased security risk inside Russia,\" Mark Molzen, the company's global issues director, said in an email. \"We have not yet experienced network disruptions but given the increasingly uncertain environment and the heightened risk of state action, we took this move to ensure the security of our and our customers' networks, as well as the ongoing integrity of the global Internet.\"The digital Iron Curtain: How Russia's internet could soon start to look a lot like China'sIt's also an unprecedented decision in some ways. Schaeffer said Cogent has previously taken down certain websites and addresses at the requests of governments in several countries, including Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States, as long as the requests have a lawful basis. \"This is different,\" he said, describing it as the first time the company has made a proactive move. \"We don't look inside of our customers' pipes, what they do with them is their business. In this case, we terminated the entire pipe.\" Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the location of Lumen Technologies' headquarters.

Begum's energy bills for her one-bedroom apartment have shot up by about \u00a370 ($92) in the past three months, even though she's using similar amounts of fuel. She works at Tesco (TSCDF), a supermarket chain, where she has seen \"every single product\" rise in price.\"Milk was 80p ($1.05).

Wages aren't keeping pace.  Read MoreAverage worker pay suffered its biggest drop in more than seven years in the three months to January, falling by 1% over the same period a year ago once inflation is taken into account, the UK Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. And the war in Ukraine has driven energy costs even higher \u2014  gasoline and diesel prices have soared to new record highs in recent days.The Boiler House has multiple sites, including the Northwold Youth & Community Hub in east London.The Boiler House Youth and Community Space started its food pantry during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike a traditional food bank, guests browse and shop for their own items, paying a \u00a36.50 ($8.50) fee to receive about \u00a335 ($46) worth of food and toiletries. But the charity's services have expanded to provide members with shoes and help paying their energy bills as many struggle with  the most severe knock to their purchasing power in years. Davina Mathurin, project officer for The Boiler House, summarized the dilemma many are facing. \"Do you either keep the house warm so [your] children don't get ill?\" she said. \"Or do [you] buy food so they can eat and they're not hungry?\"Millions of people's fuel bills rose in October when Britain's energy regulator increased its consumer price cap \u2014 the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy \u2014 by 12% after a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels.A shopper carries his purchases in Walthamstow, east London, on February 13.On the day CNN Business visited in February, Mathurin had started referring some members to fuel voucher programs organized by charities that offer up to \u00a349 ($64) to help with bills. Demand was high, she said.  Monique John, another regular visitor to the Boiler House, told CNN Business that she owns a smart meter. The device helps her conserve energy, but her money does not stretch nearly as far as it used to.  \"You just literally watch [the meter] go down and down and down and down and down,\" she said. 'There's just nothing left to give'The worst is yet to come.In April, the energy price cap will soar by 54% \u2014 its largest ever rise \u2014 burdening 22 million people with an annual bill of roughly \u00a32,000 ($2,618). Inflation is also expected to peak above 7% and a new payroll tax to help fund health and social care will take effect. Steam and smoke is seen rising from the chimneys and central heating vents of houses in January in London.The higher costs could push the number of \"destitute\" households \u2014 defined as those unable to afford basic necessities \u2014 up by a third to hit 1 million, according to analysis by The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month pushed wholesale gas prices up even further as global markets panicked over whether sanctions would hit Russian exports. Analysts at investment bank Investec said Britons' annual energy bills after October \u2014 the next time the price cap is adjusted \u2014 could rocket past \u00a33,000 ($3,927) as a result. \"Now there's just nothing left to give from people's budgets. There's no way the numbers add up now,\" Lucy Bannister, policy campaigns manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, told CNN Business.\"Children are feeling too scared to ask for the heating to be put on,\" she added. \"They're really kind of taking on that stress that they're seeing their parents go through. Feeling hungry and not asking for a snack.\"The government will try to ease the pain by cutting local taxes and allowing millions of Britons to spread the cost of their energy bills over the next few years. A government spokesperson told CNN Business that it was \"providing support worth around \u00a312 billion ($16 billion) this financial year and next, to help households with the cost of living.\"The spokesperson added that the government would raise the minimum wage by more than \u00a31,000 ($1,309) a year and hike a benefit claimed by people on low incomes by the same amount. Both will start in April.Critics say the government's response is inadequate and fails to target those who need it most. Ian Allinson, a member of the executive committee at Manchester Trades Union Council, which organized a protest against higher costs in February, said the situation is \"alarming.\" He said the government's plan to delay energy payments won't help vulnerable people.\"We're appalled when the main measure the government has announced [to bring down energy bills] is that we have to give ourselves a loan,\" he told CNN Business. \"A lot of people are struggling with debt already. The idea that there's then enforced further debt rather than any genuine help is just shocking.\"People march through  Manchester on February 12, as protests were held nationally against rising energy bills and the cost of living.Angry Britons are taking to the streets. Protesters, and the opposition Labour Party, have called for a windfall tax on energy companies like BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA), which made billions in profit last year. \"It's just scandalous that the government is choosing to not do something effective to support ordinary people but is happy to leave those mega profits for the companies that are inflicting this on us,\" Allinson said. Paychecks can't keep upAt a north London church, piles of groceries are laid out in a grid on the floor of a small side building. Volunteers are packing the donated items into bags before driving them to people's doors. Cooking Champions, an organization which caters for charitable groups and local businesses, started its delivery service in April 2020 after the pandemic hit. Annalisa Moseley is one of the first to receive her shopping. The mother-of-two said that without Cooking Champions, some weeks she would have no food. Thinking about what will happen after April is stressful, she said.   Volunteers at Cooking Champions in London create food parcels using donated and redistributed food.\"It's all on my shoulders sort of thing to make sure the kids are warm and fed and everything,\" Moseley said. \"It has been getting me down a little bit, but just got to carry on. Keep trying.\"Moseley receives Universal Credit \u2014 a benefit for people who are out of work or on low incomes. The government hiked payments by \u00a320 ($26) a week during the pandemic, but that ended in October 2021. The benefit will increase by 3.1% in April, but that's less than half the expected rate of inflation.Rising wages can't keep up either. The Spring Community Hub, a food and clothes bank 15 miles to the south across London, runs another door-to-door delivery service. Lately, volunteers have helped increasing numbers of younger and more affluent people. \"We're seeing more working people and people on those precarious hours particularly,\" CEO Felicia Boshorin told CNN Business. \"When the actual money comes, it's not enough,\" she added.Parents are 'dreading' SeptemberSeptember looms large for parents worried about the cost of school uniforms. Shirts, sweaters and jackets emblazoned with school logos \u2014 mandatory in the United Kingdom \u2014 can run into the hundreds of pounds for a single child.One in 10 British families have fallen into debt buying items needed for school, according to a 2020 survey by The Children's Society, a charity. That figure could grow in 2022 \u2014 clothes and footwear were the biggest contributors to inflation in the month to January, according to the Office for National Statistics. Caroline Rice, who lives in Northern Ireland, is \"dreading\" the new school year. She is a member of Covid Realities, a research project documenting the experiences of low income families during the pandemic. \"I can't afford \u00a3100 ($131) for oil, so why would I pay \u00a350 ($65), \u00a360 ($79) for a school blazer?\" she said.Back at The Boiler House, parents are turning up with their children to browse shelves of colorful sneakers, donations provided by charity Sal's Shoes. Begum's daughter rushes over to a pair of white and pink sparkly Converse and tries them on. \"With poverty there is that loss of dignity if you're just effectively being handed handouts,\" said CJ Bowry, the founder of Sal's Shoes.Sal's Shoes' St Paul's Centre in Crewe, on February 16.Its three pop-up stores around the country aim to give \"families a shopping experience,\" she said. \"So they can visit these shops and try on shoes and choose shoes and see a selection of shoes \u2014 but they don't have to pay.\"Sal's Shoes has sent nearly 3 million pairs to 54 countries in its eight years, though more and more are being sent closer to home. The charity distributed 48,000 pairs around the United Kingdom in 2021, its highest number ever. Bowry said she receives calls every day from school principals asking for support.\"We have headteachers who've done playground duty and then ring us because they've literally noticed children in their playground with the soles flapping off their shoes,\" she said. 'Hardship is harder'The Bank of England expects inflation to cool after peaking in April, but high prices will stick around. For people who have taken on new debts and fallen behind on their bills, there will be a scarring effect that could last for years. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that 4.4 million low income households began borrowing or added to existing debts during the pandemic. Of that number, more than two thirds are behind on their repayments. Joseph De-Ville, another member of Covid Realities, lives in Cornwall with his wife and three children. He got into debt a couple of years ago to pay for his mother's funeral, and told CNN Business about the constant struggle to provide for his family.  \"This is the parts of life that people aren't seeing,\" he said. \"We're locking it up into credit cards so we can cope, and then we're struggling to pay the debts because [of] the interest rates \u2014 because we're having to take high interest rate credit cards just so we can get by.\" For over a decade, real incomes and living standards for millions of Britons have dropped.

The company's white \u2014 or sometimes holiday-themed \u2014 logo-emblazoned paper cups for hot drinks, and clear plastic cups for cold drinks are instantly recognizable symbols of the brand. But that's not entirely a good thing. \"Our cup is ubiquitous, and we love that,\" said Michael Kobori, Starbucks chief sustainability officer. \"But it is also this ubiquitous symbol of a throwaway society.\" That's because the cups are disposable. When they are thrown away, the cups end up in landfills or as litter in streets and waterways. Some might be recycled, but recycling is an imperfect option \u2014 recyclable items still end up in landfills.The best solution? \"Eliminating the disposable cup,\" Kobori said. He called that option \"the holy grail.\"The traditional Starbucks disposable cup.Read MoreBy 2025, the company wants every customer to be able to either use their own mug easily or borrow a ceramic or reusable to-go mug from their local Starbucks. That could mean rolling out more borrow-a-mug programs that require a deposit. Starbucks is also planning, by the end of next year, to let customers use their own personal mugs at every Starbucks in the United States and Canada, even if they order ahead or use the drive-thru. The goals don't mean Starbucks will get rid of the paper and plastic cups. But they do want to make that option less attractive. That won't be easy to do, as most Starbucks customers are used to that simple, single-use option. But the company has a plan. Testing out Borrow-A-Cup programs  Examples of Starbucks' reusable cups. To phase out disposables, Starbucks is considering a widespread borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use. Amelia Landers, a vice president of product experience whose team is responsible for sustainable packaging at Starbucks, expects that this model will resonate more with customers compared to other sustainability efforts. \"I think that will take the lead,\" she said. \"We are testing a number of different [borrow-a-cup] programs around the globe,\" including \"20 different iterations and in eight different markets.\" In Seattle, Starbucks tested a beta version of such a program last year.\"We developed a new cup that had a very low environmental footprint, was lightweight polypropylene, ultimately recyclable and could replace 100 single-use disposable cups,\" Landers explained. For that test, customers paid a $1 deposit, and had to return the cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. Customers also earned rewards for using the cup.Kim Davis, who manages a store where the program was tested, said that customers were curious about the bin, and once baristas explained it to them, many were on board with the concept.  \"The excitement and engagement was really high among my customers and my [employees],\" she said. For baristas, the process was straightforward enough \u2014 they just used the reusable cup instead of a regular one to prepare drinks. A third-party company collected the dirty cups for cleaning, so baristas didn't have to worry about that part of the process. Starbucks (SBUX) is running similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.The model is the most promising because it's the easiest to integrate into customers' daily lives. You don't have to remember to bring your own reusable mug or, if you do, get stuck with a dirty cup for the rest of the day. And you don't need to sit and sip your coffee at a Starbucks, something most people don't have time for on a weekday morning. But that model is still just being tested, so the company wants to encourage the use of reusable mugs in other ways. Bringing back the personal cup  Starbucks wants all customers to be able to use reusable mugs and glasses at its stores. Early in the pandemic, when people feared that the coronavirus could spread easily on surfaces, Starbucks barred customers from bringing their own mugs. It has since brought back the option and is now trying out ways to make it more attractive. \"We're testing an incentive on the personal cup to go up from where it is today \u2014 from 10 cents to 50 cents,\" Landers said. \"We are also going to be testing a disposable cup fee.\" She added that the chain is also experimenting with discounted prices for people who use a Starbucks-provided ceramic mug in stores. That's simple enough. But it gets a lot more complicated when customers bring their own cups to the drive-thru or when they order ahead through the Starbucks app. Years ago, ordering ahead or using a drive-thru might have been a rare enough occasion. But since the pandemic, more customers have been coming through the drive-thru or ordering ahead.During a February analyst call, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri said that Starbucks' drive-thru windows and its mobile orders together account for about 70% of sales at US stores operated by the company.  So to achieve its zero-disposable-cups goal, Starbucks needs to figure out how to get reusables through a drive-thru, and make them available to customers who order ahead. To that end, Starbucks has been testing different options at its innovation center. \"We've got mock stores set up,\" said Landers. \"We have different versions of the drive-thru layout.\" Customers can simply give their cups to baristas at the drive-thru window. But Starbucks is exploring ways to make the process smoother. Pantene and Stubb's will be sold in reusable containers at some Kroger storesOne option is to allow customers to drop off their cups at an earlier point in the drive-thru lane so that the drink is ready in a personal cup once they swing around to the window, Landers said. Another is for baristas to pre-make drinks when customers place their orders, and pour them into personal tumblers at the window or when they arrive at a store to pick up their order. Starbucks is also testing out cup-washing stations in stores. The team is trying \"different things, over and over again,\" to figure out what might work, she said. \"We're right now in the middle of all of that work.\"It's crucial for Starbucks' mobile order and drive-thru experiences to be seamless. After just a few sluggish pickups, customers may take their business elsewhere.But Starbucks also has to be careful not to put too much additional burden on employees, who already have to prepare complicated, customized orders at high speeds. That's especially important now. Workers across the country are considering unionization, going against the wishes of the company's  leadership. A Starbucks, in Buffalo, New York, was the first to vote to unionize in December. Employees at a handful of other stores have since made similar efforts and several Starbucks around the country are preparing for their own votes.If the company's initiative leads to the end of paper and plastic cups at Starbucks, it will be quite an achievement.\"We know that even the most ardent of sustainability champion customers, they really don't change their behavior all that easily,\" Landers said. \"Even though they really, really want to.\" ", "keywords": ["business-food", "starbucks", "planning", "phase", "iconic", "cups", "cnn"], "category": "business"}, {"author": "Laura He, CNN Business", "date_published": "2022-03-15 03:54:42", "section": "economy", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/economy/china-jan-feb-economy-challenges-ahead-intl-hnk/index.html", "headline": "Economic growth in 2022: China had a surprisingly good start, but it may not last - CNN", "article_text": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)China's economy started the year on a bright note, with several major indicators beating forecasts.

China sets lowest economic growth target in decades as challenges mountThis is not the first time this year that Chinese authorities have underscored the importance of infrastructure expenditure. Earlier this month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the government would ramp up fiscal and monetary support for the economy this year, including spending more on infrastructure and conducting more interest rate cuts. The government has increased the broad fiscal deficit this year, implying growth in infrastructure investment, wrote Larry Hu, chief economist for Greater China at Macquarie Group, in a report on Tuesday. However, experts warn that there are multiple challenges on the horizon, including Covid and the war in Ukraine.China's new Covid lockdowns are another threat to the economyThe worst Covid-19 surge in two yearsChina is fighting its worst Covid surge since the original outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020.\"With officials ditching targeted containment measures in favor of wholesale lockdowns, this has the potential to be even more disruptive than the Delta wave last Summer, which led to a sharp contraction in economic output,\" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, on Tuesday. Even the government acknowledges that new Covid outbreaks could weigh on the economy in the coming months.\"The recent spread of the coronavirus in many parts of the country may restrict consumption further, and the foundation of the consumption is still not strong,\" Fu said. \"Sporadic outbreaks in some regions will also affect industrial growth.\"China reported 5,154 locally transmitted cases on Monday, the highest number in two years, according to the National Health Commission (NHC).To contain the spread of the virus, authorities have taken strict measures in multiple cities and placed tens of millions of people under various forms of lockdowns.Apple supplier Foxconn halts operations in Shenzhen as China locks down tech hubThe southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, has imposed a week-long lockdown since Monday.

Fu from the NBS said the direct impact of the tensions in Europe on China is \"limited,\" as its trade exposure to Russia and Ukraine is \"small.\"But he said the impact on global commodity prices is \"obvious,\" which could increase the pressure of \"imported inflation\" on China.Several food and beverage companies in China have recently hiked prices of their products, including dairy giants Yili and Mengniu.\"The recent acceleration in commodity prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exacerbated the margin pressure on packaged food companies,\" analysts from Morningstar wrote in a report on Tuesday. \"Various food and beverage companies in China have engaged in price hikes since the third quarter last year to mitigate margin compression.\" Analysis: China can't do much to help Russia's sanction-hit economyChina and Russia have forged close ties in recent years, and signed a number of commodities deals during Russian President Putin's visit to Beijing last month.

And while some expatriates can command higher salaries for simply agreeing to move to the city, the city's poorest are struggling just to afford food or basic necessities.Heading for the exitsThe widening gap comes at a time when Hong Kong is facing an exodus of expats, despite the additional benefits on offer, which continues to raise questions about its future as a global business hub.Many foreigners have had enough of the city's unwavering commitment to its \"zero Covid\" policy, even as cases surge to record highs and cause more fatalities, overloading the health care system and delivering a huge punch to the economy. Throughout 2020 and 2021, more residents left Hong Kong than came in, according to official population statistics. That marked a reversal from early 2019, when the population was going up.

Hong Kong is sticking to zero-Covid, no matter what the costThe issue has increasingly forced companies to rethink where their employees should be based, if only for now. Last month, Mandarin Oriental (MAORF) CEO James Riley told the Financial Times that the former British colony had become a \"very, very poor\" base due to the restrictions.According to the newspaper, the hotel group recently advocated for senior executives to temporarily live abroad, away from its Hong Kong headquarters. Mandarin Oriental declined to comment to CNN Business.Last year, Cathay Pacific (CPCAY) said that it would consider letting some of its pilots live abroad for a few months as aircrew continued to face arduous self-isolation measures. The carrier later said that its workers spent more than 73,000 nights in government-mandated quarantine in 2021.Hong Kong kept out Covid, but exhausted and depressed pilots are paying the priceFrench spirits maker Pernod Ricard (PDRDF) has also asked top executives from its Hong Kong office to work abroad for some time, according to unidentified sources who spoke with the FT. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Meanwhile, other players have moved away entirely.In November, FedEx (FDX) said it would shut down its crew base in Hong Kong and relocate pilots, citing the city's \"pandemic requirements.\"From the start of the pandemic through the end of last year, at least 84 companies have either closed or moved their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong, according to CNN Business calculations based on government data. Asked about the figure, a government spokesperson responded that \"Hong Kong remains a competitive city globally and a major regional base for international companies.\"The representative also pointed to emerging opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, a zone connecting Hong Kong, the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and the city of Macao as \"a market of 86 million people.\" Many banks have honed in on the area as a key priority in the coming years. The government, which includes mainland Chinese companies in its annual tally of international businesses in Hong Kong, said that the number had recently \"risen to a record high of 9,049.\"But the exodus amongst Western players may not slow down this year. BASF (BASFY), a German chemicals giant, recently relocated its chief for Asia Pacific, excluding Greater China, to Singapore \"after careful consideration of her office's strategic location in the region,\" according to the company.The decision was based on \"the requirement for proximity to relevant stakeholders and markets,\" it told CNN Business in a statement.More than 40% of expats in a survey are thinking of leaving Hong KongOthers may be biding their time. Hong Kong recently brought forward the end of the school year for some institutions to March or April, giving families more time to reevaluate their options before the new term begins in September.In some sectors, bonus season typically takes place around this period, too.\"I suspect there's a lot of international bankers who may be waiting till then before they decide whether they've had their fill of Hong Kong,\" said a person working in the finance industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.Free flights and country clubsThis exodus means that top companies in the city are working extra hard to attract \u2014 and retain \u2014 skilled workers. Two senior headhunters in Hong Kong said that job candidates were increasingly pricing in the inconvenience of living in the city \u2014 if they were even persuaded to do so.\"Most of them are just kind of immediately saying no,\" said John Mullally, regional director of Southern China and Hong Kong financial services at recruitment agency Robert Walters. \"You've got a smaller candidate pool, especially when it comes to those with overseas experience.\"Mark Tibbatts, managing director of Southern China and Taiwan for the agency Michael Page, described it as \"an ongoing battle\" that had made it \"nigh on impossible\" to lure international talent.A view of Hong Kong's skyline, captured on Wednesday.The circumstances have revived the so-called \"expat package,\" which had mostly been scrapped in recent years, according to both recruiters.\"Let's go back a couple of decades. Most of the senior expats in Hong Kong were on a pretty juicy package that might have included flights home, and education, and club memberships and all these types of things,\" said Tibbatts. \"Over the last, let's say, 10, 15 years, most of that's been phased out.\"Alibaba co-founder: Jack Ma is doing well and Hong Kong will be 'fine'Now, some of those deals are \"coming back,\" he added.Mullally also described a rising view that Hong Kong was becoming \"a bit of a hardship posting\" for expats, a term that typically refers to a place with hostile living conditions.That perception was more common from the 1970s to early 1990s, and back then justified more perks for businesspeople, he said.Now, companies are \"going to have to try to bring that back because ... realistically, if you want to attract people, that's kind of the package you'll have to put together.\"Nowhere to goAs international executives jump ship, blue-collar workers and the city's poorest are being left behind to face the darkening economic outlook. It's not just in Hong Kong: Inequality around the world has worsened throughout the pandemic, with billionaires making unprecedented gains in wealth as tens of millions of people fall into poverty. Despite a growing shortage of domestic workers in Hong Kong, \"it is not easy to say whether [the pandemic] has as a whole positively or negatively impacted them,\" said Manisha Wijesinghe, executive director of HELP for Domestic Workers.\"We definitely have seen a number of domestic workers who are being offered higher than statutorily mandated wages due to the shortage of incoming domestic workers,\" she said.JUST WATCHEDHear how restrictions in Hong Kong are affecting their citizensReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear how restrictions in Hong Kong are affecting their citizens 02:51\"But we have also seen domestic workers being forced to take on salaries lower than the minimum allowable wage ... there is a power imbalance.\" From January 2020 to the end of 2021, the city's number of domestic workers dropped from more than 400,000 to roughly 340,000, according to government statistics. In a recent blog post, Hong Kong Labor Secretary Law Chi-kwong pointed to flight bans from certain countries as a possible reason for the slump, saying that some workers had likely been stranded abroad.When asked about the plight of domestic workers, authorities told CNN Business that foreign workers who test positive for Covid-19 \"will receive support and medical treatment like local people in Hong Kong.\" And, if unemployed, they will be admitted to community isolation facilities, they said. A government spokesperson also said that it \"has continuously reminded employers of their statutory obligations and requirements\" during the pandemic, and \"any breach of such requirements will render them ineligible to employ [a domestic worker] for a period of time.\" 'Zero income'While big international firms may have the privilege to up and move, most local businesses have no choice but to hunker down.As many as 50,000 small businesses could shut down over the city's fifth wave of Covid, estimates Danny Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association.That's about one in seven such registered entities across the city \u2014 and there could be more, he said.Despite soaring infections, Hong Kong officials have been holding onto the \"zero Covid\" strategy in recent weeks, introducing social distancing restrictions that have stifled local activity. Hong Kong is facing an exodus of educated workers on a scale not seen since the early 1990s.Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of CommerceMany places, such as beauty parlors and fitness studios, have been forced to stop operating for months until the current measures end.\"They don't have any income. Zero income,\" Lau said of those business owners. He added that some had resorted to operating secretly just to keep making a living.Like elsewhere, small businesses had already been hit hard earlier in the pandemic, especially by the lack of tourists.These firms were \"almost half dead,\" said Lau, noting that some entrepreneurs had already taken out significant loans or dug into their reserves just to stay afloat.\"The worst thing is you cannot see the future,\" he added. \"We don't know how long these restrictions will last for.\"", "keywords": ["business", "hong", "kong", "covid", "divide", "expats", "get", "perks", "domestic", "workers", "lose", "homes", "cnn"], "category": "business"}, {"author": "Laura He and Eric Cheung, CNN Business", "date_published": "2022-03-14 09:50:22", "section": "tech", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/tech/shenzhen-lockdown-foxconn-operations-intl-hnk/index.html", "headline": "Shenzhen lockdown: Foxconn halts operations as Covid hits tech hub - CNN", "article_text": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)Foxconn, one of Apple's biggest suppliers, has suspended operations in Shenzhen as China locks down the technology hub and several other regions to contain the country's worst Covid-19 outbreak in two years.The world's second largest economy is still doggedly pursuing its zero-Covid strategy, even as other nations reopen and try to live with the virus. The lockdowns in major Chinese cities will impact not just the country's post-pandemic recovery, but could deliver a new blow to global supply chains.The southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, is home to Chinese tech giants like Tencent (TCEHY) and Huawei. It imposed a week-long lockdown starting Monday, after recording 66 positive cases Saturday.In its statement provided to CNN Business on Monday, Foxconn said that the \"date of factory resumption is to be advised by the local government.\"Foxconn has two major campuses in Shenzhen.

China sets lowest economic growth target in decades as challenges mountChina is grappling with its worst Covid outbreak since the original outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020 as cases surge across the country. On Sunday, it reported 2,125 local Covid-19 cases across 58 cities, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). In Shenzhen, all businesses \u2014 apart from those deemed essential or engaged in supplying Hong Kong \u2014 have suspended operation or have implemented work-from-home policies. Public transportation, including subways and buses, have been suspended in the city, which has a population of 17.5 million.Shenzhen is also home to one of the world's largest container ports, and any disruption there could hit an already stressed out global supply chain. Last summer, the Yantian port in Shenzhen was forced to shut down for nearly a week after infections were found among dock workers, causing a massive backlog of goods that took months to clear and a spike in global freight rates. So far the port continues to operate.Shares of major companies based in Shenzhen fared poorly in Hong Kong on Monday. Tencent sank 9.8%. Telecoms firm ZTE (ZTCOF) lost 7%. BYD (BYDDF), China's largest electric car manufacturer, fell 8.3%. And AAC Technologies (AACAF), an audio components maker, plunged 9%.Apart from Shenzhen, local authorities have also locked down the northeastern industrial hub of Changchun since Friday, where nine million residents were forbidden from leaving their neighborhoods.

These lockdowns come just months after China shut the northwestern city of Xi'an, which hit major business operations, including those of Samsung and Micron, two of the world's biggest chipmakers.These stringent measures taken to control the pandemic have hit China's economy hard in recent times.

But another economic indicator is starting to look ominous: The yield curve is flattening.Wall Street closely watches the difference, or spread, between short-term government bond yields, most notably the 2-year Treasury, and longer-term bond rates like the 10-year Treasury. As that spread diminishes, investors worry that the yield curve could eventually invert, meaning that short-term rates would be higher than long-term yields. As of Friday, the difference was just 0.25%, with the 10-year yield at around 2% and the 2-year yielding 1.75%. The gap widened a bit Monday, as the 10-year rose to 2.1% and the 2-year yield was up to about 1.82%, making the spread 0.28%.Inverted yield curve often occurs before recessionsRead MoreAn inverted yield curve has often been a potential recession signal. The yield curve inverted in 2019 before the 2020 Covid-induced recession. It also did so in 2007 before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis/Great Recession. And it inverted in early 2000 right before the dot-com/tech stock meltdown.US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told CNN's Poppy Harlow that a recession is \"a real likelihood\" but he added that \"we have a very strong economy\" and noted that the job market in particular is healthy.When investors want higher rates for short-term bonds, it's an indication that bondholders are nervous. Typically, rates for long-term bonds are higher because you have to wait longer to get paid back. So how worried should investors be that the yield curve might invert?Some argue that the only reason this is happening is because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting spike in commodity prices. \"The risks of a recession are building but not necessarily immediate unless the global geopolitics dramatically deteriorate from this delicate starting point,\" Jim Reid, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said in a report.The Fed's job just got even harderThe Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later this week, may be careful to not raise rates so aggressively that short-term yields increase even further and wind up flipping the yield curve. That could cause a slowdown in the job market. And the Fed is supposed to keep an eye on unemployment rates as well as inflation.\"Chair [Jerome] Powell will make it clear that the Fed is aware of its dual mandate and does not want to invert the yield curve and produce a recession,\" Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said in a report.  Inflation concerns existed before Russia-UkraineAlthough geopolitical tension could be distorting prices, inflation pressures were already building before the Russian attack on Ukraine.\"Russia/Ukraine is only pulling forward the natural slowing in the economy that would have occurred as the Fed tightened policy,\" said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note last week. Essaye argues that Fed rate hikes and a slowing economy would have likely led to an inverted yield curve at some point later this year even if Russia and Ukraine weren't in the headlines.\"The looming rate hikes (which are still coming) will combine with the growth slowing impulse of higher commodity prices and higher inflation to bring a sooner than previously expected slowing of growth,\" he said.Rising short-term rates could also create problems for large Wall Street firms. Although higher rates tend to boost profits for loans, they also make trading, particularly for bonds, more of a gamble.

Rates fall when investors are buying bonds. So traders are clearly still finding US Treasury debt to be stable enough to keep flocking to it. But it is unusual to see short-term rates fall this sharply.One strategist noted that it doesn't matter if investors are buying bonds because they perceive them to be safe. There is still a lot to worry about. \"The recession drumbeat is gaining in volume,\" Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, said in a report. \"Of course there are many reasons to be concerned. Soaring inflation, rising energy costs, an almost sure recession in the Euro Zone and a dangerously flat yield curve.\" \"Never mind that the yield curve is being distorted by a massive flight to quality,\" Tengler added. \"An inversion is an inversion.\" ", "keywords": ["economy", "us", "economy", "flashes", "recession", "warning", "sign", "cnn"], "category": "business"}]
